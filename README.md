# gh-self-update

An [extension] to the [Github CLI] which updates the CLI installation if it is outdated (by downloading the latest dep package from the releases page, and installing it with `apt`).

[Github CLI]: https://cli.github.com
[extension]: https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/using-github-cli-extensions

Created as a hack to get around the annoying GPG key failures which have plagued the project lately.
